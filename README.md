# NY Health Disparities: Income & Longevity

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between income levels and health outcomes across New York State using **County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R) data**. By analyzing **social determinants of health (SDOH)**—including healthcare access, chronic disease prevalence, and neighborhood conditions—this study aims to determine whether income is the primary factor driving health disparities or if broader social factors play a larger role.

## Research Question
Does higher income directly correlate with better health outcomes and longer life expectancy, or do social determinants of health (SDOH) contribute more significantly to disparities in longevity?

## Data Sources
The primary dataset comes from **County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R)** and is supplemented by:
- **U.S. Census Bureau – American Community Survey (ACS)** (income & demographic data)
- **National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)** (mortality rates & cause-specific deaths)
- **CDC PLACES** (obesity, diabetes, and self-reported health trends)

## Project Goals
- **Analyze health disparities** by income level across New York counties
- **Investigate the impact of SDOH** (education, healthcare access, neighborhood safety, etc.)
- **Develop statistical models** to predict longevity and health risks based on socioeconomic status
- **Communicate findings effectively** through visualizations and a structured data story
